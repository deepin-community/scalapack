  * debian patch install_libdir_multiarch.patch installs libraries,
    cmake and pkgconfig files into multiarch destinations
    (CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR from GNUInstallDirs). Closes: #1051986.
  * extend debian patch sharedlibs-soname.patch to add MPI_FLAVOR
    suffix to installed pkgconfig files and cmake install dirs.
    Simplifies package install scripts (executable scripts no longer

scalapack (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * Fix FTBFS against cmake 3.24.
    The CMakeFiles/Export/ subdirectory structure has changed between CMake 3.23
    and 3.24. We are relying on this directory for installing
    scalapack-targets-none.cmake, which differs between OpenMPI and MPICH.
    Adapt libscalapack-{openmpi,mpich}-dev.install accordingly.
    See https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23883
    (Closes: #1020170)

  * New upstream major release (soname bump to 2.2).
    (technically a minor version update, but the debian soname tracks
     the major.minor version)
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0
  * debian patch restore_mpifort_revert_PR39.patch reverts upstream
    PR#39 to restore assignment of MPI_Fortran_COMPILER as
    CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER. Otherwise tests fail to link libmpi.so
    cf. https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack/issues/47

  * Team upload.
  * retrospectively place Adam C. Powell, IV's name in quotes
  * override lintian's breakout-link warning for scalapack-mpi-test.
    Test binaries in usr/lib look locally for test input files which
    are stored in usr/share, hence links are needed.
  * inject CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE into
    scalapack-targets-none.cmake for arch-dep packages
    (libscalapack-*-dev) not arch-indep.
  * don't run full configure/build/test for arch-indep builds
    (scalapack-test-common does not need arch-dep binaries)
